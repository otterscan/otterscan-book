# Production

In a production environment, the `VITE_CONFIG_JSON` environment variable __needs__ to be defined at build time, otherwise it has no effect; in that case, the node/chain config will be static.

That way the config won't need to be fetched from serverâ€”one less network call on page load. That's the recommended setting for controlled hosted environments where you control the node your users will connect to.

You can either:

- Make your CI `export` a `VITE_CONFIG_JSON` env variable with the desired settings.
- During build time, make sure there is a `.env.production` file with a `VITE_CONFIG_JSON` variable defined in it.
