# Options

Otterscan can be customized in many different ways.

- [Branding](./branding.md)

If your chain is an Optimism L2 Superchain, you can wire that Otterscan instance with an L1 one.

- [Optimism](./optimism.md)

Price resolvers can be customized as well.

- [Price oracles](./oracles.md)

If you are running Otterscan against a non-standard chain, but you are sure Erigon can run it, you can explicitly specify the configuration.

- [Recognizing nonstandard chains](./chains.md)
