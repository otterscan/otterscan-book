# Contract verification

In this chapter we explain how contract verification works in Otterscan.

> 💡 If you are not interested in how contract verification works under the hood, you can skip this chapter.

We use Sourcify and the next section explains how the integration works.

- [Sourcify](./sourcify/)

In case you want to run Sourcify against a devnet or a custom chain not enabled in Sourcify's official hosted service, you can run your own instance of Sourcify and point Otterscan to it.

- [Self-hosted Sourcify](./self-hosted-sourcify/)

You can also host a Sourcify repository using a lightweight HTTP server:

- [Lightweight Self-hosted Repo](./lightweight-sourcify-server.md)
