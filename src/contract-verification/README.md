# Contract verification

In this chapter we explain how contract verification works in Otterscan.

> ðŸ’¡ If you are not interested in how contract verification works under the hood, you can skip this chapter.

We use Sourcify and the next section explains how the integration works.

- [Sourcify](./sourcify/)

In case you want to run Sourcify against a devnet or a custom chain not enabled in Sourcify's official hosted service, you can run your own instance of Sourcify and point Otterscan to it.

- [Self-hosted Sourcify](./self-hosted-sourcify/)
