# Integration modes

Otterscan supports multiple ways to consume Sourcify data, each one with pros and cons:

## Direct HTTP connection to Sourcify's repository

Standard HTTP connection to the official Sourcify repository at <https://repo.sourcify.dev/>

Fast access to freshly verified data. On the other hand, it is centralized and leaks all addresses you visit in Otterscan to the Sourcify server.

> ðŸ’¡ This is the default method Otterscan uses out of the box.

## IPFS

We resolve the public Sourcify IPNS to get the latest known IPFS root hash of their repository.

The downside is that recently verified contracts may not have been added yet to the root hash and republished into IPNS.

It uses the public gateway at <https://ipfs.io> by default.

Please see our [ipfs integration docs](./ipfs.md) for more info about how we handle all IPFS integrations and privacy concerns.
