# Acknowledgments

## Kudos (in no particular order)

We make use of open-source software and integrate many public data sources, mainly:

To the [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org/) team whose code Erigon is based on.

To the [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) team that made it possible for regular humans to run an archive node on a retail laptop. Also, they have been very helpful explaining Erigon's internals which made the Otterscan modifications possible.

To the [Test in Prod](https://www.testinprod.io/) team that made OP-Erigon. Their effort made it possible to run Otterscan against any Optimism Superchain.

To the [mdbx](https://github.com/erthink/libmdbx) team which created the blazingly fast database that empowers Erigon.

To [Trust Wallet](https://github.com/trustwallet/assets) who sponsors and makes available their icons under a permissive license.

To the owners of the [4bytes repository](https://github.com/ethereum-lists/4bytes) that we import and use to translate method selectors to human-friendly strings.

To [Sourcify](https://sourcify.dev/), a public, decentralized source code and metadata verification service.

To [Ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/), which is the client library we used to interact with the Erigon node. It is high-level enough to hide most JSON-RPC particularities but flexible enough to allow for easy interaction with custom methods.
